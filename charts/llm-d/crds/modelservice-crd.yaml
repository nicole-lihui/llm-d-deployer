                      should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2].
                      For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:
                      "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered
                      the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with
                      index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of
                      referencing a part of an object.

                            The container image's ENTRYPOINT is used if this is not provided.
                            Variable references $(VAR_NAME) are expanded using the container's environment. If a variable
                            cannot be resolved, the reference in the input string will be unchanged. Double $$ are reduced
                            to a single $, which allows for escaping the $(VAR_NAME) syntax: i.e. "$$(VAR_NAME)" will
                            produce the string literal "$(VAR_NAME)". Escaped references will never be expanded, regardless
                            of whether the variable exists or not. Cannot be updated.

                      GatewayRef is merged to baseconfig based on the Name field.
                      Directly from Gateway API: https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/reference/spec/#commonroutespec
                      ParentRefs references the resources (usually Gateways) that a Route wants
                      to be attached to. Note that the referenced parent resource needs to
                      allow this for the attachment to be complete. For Gateways, that means
                      the Gateway needs to allow attachment from Routes of this kind and
                      namespace. For Services, that means the Service must either be in the same
                      namespace for a "producer" route, or the mesh implementation must support
                      and allow "consumer" routes for the referenced Service. ReferenceGrant is
                      not applicable for governing ParentRefs to Services - it is not possible to
                      create a "producer" route for a Service in a different namespace from the
                      Route.

                      There are two kinds of parent resources with "Core" support:

                      * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)
                      * Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)

                      This API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of parent
                      resources.

                      ParentRefs must be _distinct_. This means either that:

                      * They select different objects.  If this is the case, then parentRef
                        entries are distinct. In terms of fields, this means that the
                        multi-part key defined by `group`, `kind`, `namespace`, and `name` must
                        be unique across all parentRef entries in the Route.
                      * They do not select different objects, but for each optional field used,
                        each ParentRef that selects the same object must set the same set of
                        optional fields to different values. If one ParentRef sets a
                        combination of optional fields, all must set the same combination.

                      Some examples:

                      * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all ParentRefs referencing the
                        same object must also set `sectionName`.
                      * If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same
                        object must also set `port`.
                      * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName` and `port`, all ParentRefs
                        referencing the same object must also set `sectionName` and `port`.

                      It is possible to separately reference multiple distinct objects that may
                      be collapsed by an implementation. For example, some implementations may
                      choose to merge compatible Gateway Listeners together. If that is the
                      case, the list of routes attached to those resources should also be
                      merged.

                      Note that for ParentRefs that cross namespace boundaries, there are specific
                      rules. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
                      allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example,
                      Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
                      generic way to enable other kinds of cross-namespace reference.

                      <gateway:experimental:description>
                      ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in the same namespace are "producer"
                      routes, which apply default routing rules to inbound connections from
                      any namespace to the Service.

                      ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in a different namespace are
                      "consumer" routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outbound
                      connections originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which
                      the intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as a
                      ParentRef of the Route.

                      ModelName is the model field within inference request
                      This should be unique across ModelService objects.

                      If the name is reused, an error will be
                      shown on the status of a ModelService that attempted to reuse.
                      The oldest ModelService, based on creation timestamp, will be selected
                      to remain valid. In the event of a race condition, one will be selected
                      arbitrarily.

                      refer to https://gateway-api-inference-extension.sigs.k8s.io
                      for relationship between model name, inference pool, and inference model

                      From GIE:
                      ModelName is the name of the model as it will be set in the "model" parameter for an incoming request.
                      ModelNames must be unique for a referencing InferencePool
                      (names can be reused for a different pool in the same cluster).
                      The modelName with the oldest creation timestamp is retained, and the incoming
                      InferenceModel is sets the Ready status to false with a corresponding reason.
                      In the rare case of a race condition, one Model will be selected randomly to be considered valid, and the other rejected.
                      Names can be reserved without an underlying model configured in the pool.
                      This can be done by specifying a target model and setting the weight to zero,
                      an error will be returned specifying that no valid target model is found.
